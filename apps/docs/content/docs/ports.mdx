title: Port Management
description: View and manage active ports per workspace
---

## Overview

Superset does not assign per-workspace port ranges. It discovers listening ports from processes running in each workspace and lets you manage them from the UI.

## Features

- **View active ports** - See which processes are using which ports
- **Kill processes** - Stop a process by clicking its port
- **Workspace grouping** - Ports are grouped by the workspace that owns the process

## Static Port Configuration

Override automatic port discovery with a static configuration file. Useful for:

- Documenting ports that aren't auto-detected (databases, external services)
- Providing meaningful labels for your team
- Projects where dynamic scanning doesn't work well

Create `.superset/ports.json` in your repository:

```json
{
  "ports": [
    { "port": 3000, "label": "Frontend Dev Server" },
    { "port": 8080, "label": "API Server" },
    { "port": 5432, "label": "PostgreSQL" }
  ]
}
```

**Fields:**
- `port` - Port number (1-65535)
- `label` - Display text shown in tooltip

**Behavior:**
- Static config replaces dynamic port discovery
- Each workspace reads from its own worktree's file
- Changes are detected automatically
- Ports open `localhost:PORT` in browser when clicked

**Error Handling:**

If `ports.json` is malformed:
- Error toast appears with details
- No ports displayed until fixed
- Dynamic detection is NOT used as fallback

**Tips:**
- Commit `.superset/ports.json` to share port labels with your team
- **Pro tip:** If you want deterministic per-workspace port ranges, implement it in setup/teardown scripts by reserving a range in a shared file (for example `~/.superset/port-allocations.json`) during setup and releasing it during teardown. See this repo's examples: [`.superset/setup.sh`](https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/blob/main/.superset/setup.sh) and [`.superset/teardown.sh`](https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/blob/main/.superset/teardown.sh).
