## Notification Sounds

Get audio notifications when agents finish or terminals exit.

Settings → Notifications → Choose a sound

Import custom ringtone audio files (MP3, WAV, OGG, up to 20MB) from **Settings → Ringtones**. Preview any imported sound and set it as your active notification.

## Project Colors

Color-code your projects in the sidebar for quick identification.

Click project settings → Choose a color

## Default Editor

Set which editor opens when you press ⌘O.

Settings → Editor → Select Cursor, VS Code, or other

## File Open Mode

Control how files open when clicked in the file tree or changes view.

Settings → Behavior → File open mode

- **Split pane** (default) - Opens files by splitting the current tab
- **New tab** - Opens files in a new tab

Preview pane reuse works in both modes—this setting only affects the fallback when no reusable pane exists.

## Terminal Presets

Save terminal configurations (commands, environment) as presets for quick access.

Settings → Terminal → Manage Presets

## Custom Themes

Download a base theme JSON, ask an agent to customize it, then import it in desktop settings.

Settings → Appearance → Theme → Download Base File / Import Theme
