---

## Overview

Superset includes a built-in browser pane so you can preview your running services without leaving the app.

## Open a Browser Tab

- Press **⌘⇧B** to open a new browser tab
- Click the external link icon on any detected port in the sidebar to open it in the browser

## Navigation

The browser pane includes a full address bar with:

- Back, forward, and reload buttons
- URL autocomplete based on your browsing history
- Favicon display for visited sites

## Browsing History

URLs you visit are saved locally and appear as autocomplete suggestions. To clear your history:

1. Click the overflow menu (⋯) in the browser toolbar
2. Select **Clear Browsing History**

## DevTools

Open the DevTools pane alongside any browser tab to inspect and debug the page running in the browser.

## Ports Integration

When Superset detects a port in use (e.g. `localhost:3000`), clicking its external link icon opens it in an in-app browser tab instead of the system browser.
