## Copilot, Cursor Agent, and Gemini Support <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1630" /> <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1625" /> <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1620" />

Superset now supports Copilot, Cursor Agent, and Gemini CLI alongside Claude, Codex, and OpenCode. This release adds built-in presets and hook support for Copilot and Gemini, and Cursor Agent is available as a first-class agent option in the multi-agent workflow.

- Ready-to-use terminal presets for Copilot and Gemini CLI
- Cursor Agent support available now in agent selection and commands
- Correct defaults per agent (`--allow-all` for Copilot, `-y` for Gemini)
- Superset notification hooks surface agent task completions in the UI

## Configurable Worktree Location <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1626" />

Set a custom base directory for new worktrees in Settings > Behavior. You can also override this per-project in Project settings. The per-project setting takes precedence, with a reset option that falls back to the global default.

## New Project Page <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1623" />

Project creation now has a dedicated full-page experience instead of a dialog. Navigate to it from the welcome screen or sidebar footer and choose between two options available now: create an empty Git repo or clone from a URL. A template starter tab is visible and marked "coming soon." A directory picker defaults to `~/.superset/projects` with a native browse button.

## Chat UI Overhaul (Early access only) <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1693" /> <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1697" />

The chat interface got a significant visual refresh. Streaming messages now animate with a progressive typing effect, tool output panels are collapsible to reduce noise, and loading/thinking states use a unified compact shimmer. The input composer has been redesigned with pill-shaped toolbar buttons, a circular submit button, and a cleaner layout with a hint row showing `@` mentions and `/commands` shortcuts.

- Progressive typing animation for streaming messages
- Collapsible tool output panels with inline status icons
- Pill-style controls for model picker, permission mode, and thinking toggle
- Permission mode labels clarified: Auto, Semi-auto, and Manual
