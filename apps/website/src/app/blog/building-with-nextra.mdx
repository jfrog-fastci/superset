# Building with Nextra

Today we're excited to share how we integrated Nextra into our project for both documentation and blog content.

## Why Nextra?

Nextra is a powerful Next.js-based framework that makes it easy to create beautiful documentation and blog sites:

- **MDX Support** - Write content in Markdown with React components
- **Built-in Themes** - Docs and blog themes ready to use
- **Search** - Full-text search out of the box
- **Fast** - Built on Next.js App Router for optimal performance

## Our Setup

We've created two separate routes:

### Documentation (`/docs`)

Our documentation uses the `nextra-theme-docs` theme with:

```tsx
import { Layout, Navbar, Footer } from "nextra-theme-docs";
```

This provides a clean, organized layout perfect for technical documentation.

### Blog (`/blog`)

Our blog uses the `nextra-theme-blog` theme:

```tsx
import { Layout, Navbar, Footer, ThemeSwitch } from "nextra-theme-blog";
```

This gives us a beautiful blog interface with features like:
- Post listings
- Dark mode support
- RSS feed support
- Tag/category organization

## Benefits

The best part about this setup is that we can:

1. **Write in Markdown** - No complex CMS needed
2. **Version Control** - All content lives in Git
3. **Type Safety** - TypeScript support throughout
4. **Fast Builds** - Optimized by Turborepo
